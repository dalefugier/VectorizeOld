### Overview

The inspiration for Vectorize comes from Gérard Bouteau, a long time Rhino user, trainer, and programmer, who developed a plug-in named [Trace](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/trace) for Rhino 6. Unfortunately for all of us, Gérard passed away unexpectedly in the spring of 2020. Because of this untimely passing, he was never able to port his popular plug-in to Rhino 7 and beyond.

### Details

Vectorize is based off the famous [Potrace](http://potrace.sourceforge.net/) by Peter Selinger, whose application transforms a bitmap into a soft, scalable image made up of vectors. The plug-in uses a C# translation named [CsPotrace](https://www.drawing3d.de/Downloads.aspx) written by Wolfgang Nagl.

### Prerequisites

The following tool is required to build Vectorize :

- [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). Visual Studio comes in three editions: Community (free), Professional, and Enterprise. All of these editions will work.

Note, the solution uses the [RhinoCommon](https://www.nuget.org/packages/rhinocommon) package available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/).

### Compiling

1. Clone the repository. At a command prompt, enter the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/dalefugier/Vectorize
```

2. Open the `Vectorize.sln` solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Press <kbd>F7</kbd>, or click *Build > Build Solution*  to build the solution.
